    <p>A paragraph consists of one or more sentences
        that form a self-contained unit of discourse. The
        start of a paragraph is indicated by a new
        line.</p>
    <p>Text is easier to understand when it is split up
        into units of text. For example, a book may have
        chapters. Chapters can have subheadings. Under
        each heading there will be one or more
        paragraphs.</p>
